This is the PCM MATLAB package for perspective M-estimation accompanying the paper
[Proximal Analysis for Perspective M-estimation](...). The package introduces an optimization model 
for maximum likelihood-type estimation (M-estimation) that generalizes 
a large class of known statistical models, including Huberâ€™s concomitant M- estimation model, 
the scaled Lasso, Support Vector Machine Regression, and penalized estimation with structured sparsity. 
The model, termed perspective M-estimation, leverages the observation that convex M-estimators with 
concomitant scale as well as structured norms are instances of perspective functions. 

The code developed here also builds on prior work:
[Perspective functions: Proximal calculus and applications in high-dimensional statistics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022247X16308071)
