PerspeCtive M-estimation (PCM) package 
=========

This is the PCM MATLAB package for perspective M-estimation. 
The package introduces an optimization model for maximum likelihood-type estimation (M-estimation) 
that generalizes a large class of known statistical models, including Huberâ€™s concomitant M-estimation model, 
the scaled Lasso, \nu-Support Vector Machine Regression, and penalized estimation with structured sparsity. 
The model, termed perspective M-estimation, leverages the observation that a wide class of 
convex M-estimators with concomitant scale as well as structured norms are instances of perspective functions. 

The code developed here also builds on prior work:

## Installation ##

The package is mostly self-contained. No external software needed. Run the addPCM.m script to include 
the subfolders to your MATLAB path. Some of the functions for testing require an installation of cvx.

## Basic Usage ##

In the /examples/ folder you find several examples about the different modes of usage. 
Please refer to the README.md in the folder for further information.
